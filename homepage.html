                    As someone who is self-taught, I have developed and honed my technical abilities through hands-on projects with various clients as a self-employed, freelance programmer and developer, in addition to continuous self-taught learning.<br><br>
                    Some tools and platforms I use frequently include Git, GitHub, Kaggle, LeetCode, Tableau, VS Code, Jupyter Notebooks, Bootstrap...<br><br>
                    I may not have a traditional university background, although that has not stood in the way of being able to cultivate an extensive understanding of programming languages; JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, SQL. In addition to libraries and frameworks such as; CSS, Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Keras, Decision Trees, CNN, PyGame, the list goes on.<br><br>
                    To develop, or program is to design and create. As someone who loves the arts, I am always excited to incorporate the fine arts into my work. Through web, mobile application, and game development, I have been able to focus in greater detail on the UI part of programming, allowing me to explore more creative ideas when it comes to developing.<br><br>
                    With all of the above having thrived in a self-directed learning environment, I am adept at quickly grasping new concepts and technologies. With technical proficiency as well as a strong work ethic and adaptability, many things are possible.<br><br>
                    Moreover, my experience as a self-employed individual has instilled in me a sense of responsibility, resourcefulness, and initiative, which I believe are crucial traits for success in any role.

                Born August 13th, 2004 making me still a young padawan. Although, inspite of being young I stil find importance in resilience, hard work, and diligence.<br><br>
                In my free time you will most likely find me anywhere outside. Living in Vancouver, a sunny day is never wasted inside. I love to hike, camp, and explore new places.<br><br>
                Although, this is all whenever I can make the time to step away from my computer...<br><br>
                Right now, I am currently focusing my interests on animation and more UI based aspects for my own self development.

            <p class="bio-text2">
                I blend code with creativity. From designing animated UIs to building interactive games with PyGame, I treat every project like a canvas.<br><br>
                My favorite tools for visual design include Figma, Adobe XD, and CSS animations. I believe great software should feel as good as it functions.
