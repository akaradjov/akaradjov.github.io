                    As someone who is self-taught, I have developed and honed my technical abilities through hands-on projects with various clients as a self-employed, freelance programmer and developer, in addition to continuous self-taught learning. <br><br>
                    Some tools and platforms I use frequently include Git, GitHub, Kaggle, LeetCode, Tableau, VS Code, Jupyter Notebooks, Bootstrap... <br><br>
                    I may not have a traditional university background, although that has not stood in the way of being able to cultivate an extensive understanding of programming languages; JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, SQL. In addition to libraries and frameworks such as; CSS, Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Keras, Decision Trees, CNN, PyGame, the list goes on. <br><br>
                    To develop, or program is to design and create. As someone who loves the arts, I am always excited to incorporate the fine arts into my work. Through web, mobile application, and game development, I have been able to focus in greater detail on the UI part of programming, allowing me to explore more creative ideas when it comes to developing. <br><br>
                    With all of the above having thrived in a self-directed learning environment, I am adept at quickly grasping new concepts and technologies. With technical proficiency as well as a strong work ethic and adaptability, many things are possible. <br><br>
                    Moreover, my experience as a self-employed individual has instilled in me a sense of responsibility, resourcefulness, and initiative, which I believe are crucial traits for success in any role.

                In my free time you will most likely find me anywhere outside. Living in Vancouver, a sunny day is never wasted inside. I love to hike, camp, and explore new places.
